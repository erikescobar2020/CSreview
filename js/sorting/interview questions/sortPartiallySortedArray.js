/*
    Problem Statement:

        - given a partially sorted array, where every element is at max k elements
        from its final position, find the optimal way to sort it

        - i.e. given an array, and given k = 3, you know every element is max 3 shifts 
        away from where it would be if sorted
            - it could be shifted 3 spots left or right!
            - that is some elments may be shifted left while others are shifted right
