/*

  Why Trees?
    - DS that is useful if data is heiarchal in structure
    - Type of tree (BST) helps us find items in less than linear time
    - it was 1 root
    - No Cycles in the structure (each child can have only one parent)
    - Height of a tree -> max number of nodes you must traverse to get from the top to the bottom
    of the tree
